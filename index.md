Hello! I am a financial economist with interests in Retail Trading, Household & Consumer Finance, and FinTech. My research, broadly, aims to understand how consumers interact with financial markets
and the frictions that they face. I am excited to be joining the University of Mississippi as an Assistant Professor of Finance in Fall 2025.

I am also a proud alumnus of the University of Illinois, <i> Ph.D. Finance,</i> and Unversity of South Florida, <i> B.S. Quantiative Economics and Econometrics.</i>
